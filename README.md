## Standard-Playable
MTG Standard Dashboard is a personal project I was working on to better learn Snowflake. The goals for this project is to create as series of dashboards which show current trends in the competitive scene of the Standard format in magic the gathering. This project was inspired by the [10th Edition Meta Data Dashboard](https://www.stat-check.com/the-meta) created by [Stat Check](https://www.facebook.com/StatCheck40k/) to track the meta in Warhammer 40k. 
# Overview of The Project
The data for the dashboard is pulled from two different places. All base card data id from [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/) through the Scryfall API. All competitive data is from MTG
